    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm Mojtaba (Moji) Heydari, a researcher in AI. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions in the field of audio processing. I specialize in Generative AI for Audio, Music, and Content, with a focus on real-time AI inference for on-device applications. My expertise spans causal inference, audio/music information retrieval, and deepfake detection, solving complex problems at the intersection of machine learning and audio innovation.</p>

    <p>During my career at companies such as Apple, TikTok, and SiriusXM, I developed cutting-edge AI projects that pushed the boundaries of what’s possible in audio AI. I’m well-versed in scaling AI solutions, from large-scale distributed training to optimizing state-of-the-art AI models for real-world deployment.</p>

    <p>I’m passionate about contributing to the AI community and have open-sourced several influential projects, including BeatNet—which has garnered over 64,000 downloads, reflecting its impact on both research and development.</p>

    <p>Let’s connect and explore how we can drive the future of AI together.</p>
